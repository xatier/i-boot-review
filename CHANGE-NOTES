documentation at http://www.intrinsyc.com

Version 1.7
  -- Implemented detection of an SMSC91C111 bug that causes some sent packets

     some people have found with TFTP transfers failing (bug #916, #1022)
  -- Reduced ARP timeout and fixed cache in case of no reply
  -- Fixed ARP to be more robust and accept only correct responses
  -- Changed bootme command to send proper I-Boot version number
  -- Added nonvolatile configuration storage in tagged EEPROM format
     (bug #1013).
  -- Set clock speed on PXA250 to 200 MHz, the minimum allowed.
  -- Added exception vectors to reboot CPU if they are hit.
  -- Moved MSC0 setting code to run out of RAM so that the flash type can
     be changed.
  -- Added set speed command (bug #1014).
  -- Enabled CS8900 detection
  -- Fixed bug in eraseflash that didn't allow erasing the last block
  -- Fixed the RAM start entry point to handle a change in CPU modes
  -- Added jump command
  -- Allow spaces in download file names by backslash escaping

Version 1.6
  -- Added support for production PXA250 CerfBoard
  -- Fixed deep sleep wakeup
  -- Make a TFTP download failure more obvious
  -- Support new Linux position independent zImage bootstrap
  -- Added new r2 parameter when booting Linux
  -- Improved robustness of XMODEM in presence of poorly written senders
  -- Corrected help for crc command
  -- Display two MAC addresses in info command only when two are possible
  -- Renamed some configure options

Version 1.5
  -- Added createfis command to pass custom partition layout to Linux
  -- Fixed problem of I-Boot hanging on SA-1110 when some PCMCIA cards are
     installed
  -- CS8900 Ethernet MAC address is now stored in the standard reset
     configuration block format in EEPROM
  -- Beep and ignore unsupported control characters in input
  -- Added background packet processing during idle loops
  -- Fixed bug that prevented TFTP working between some different subnetworks
  -- Implemented basic ICMP support so device can be pinged and tracerouted
  -- Added ping command
  -- Improved command-line editor to retrieve last command
  -- Added reboot command
  -- Added XMODEM option to download command
  -- Added entry point to run I-Boot from another bootloader directly in RAM
  -- Added more configuration options to give more control over what happens
     in the boot process
  -- Fixed the architecture type number when booting Linux on the PXA250
  -- Improved handling of flash write errors

Version 1.4
  -- Added download raw command.
  -- Added experimental deep sleep mode support.
  -- Renamed SA targets.
  -- Made IP stack more resilient to bad and unexpected input.
  -- Improved DHCP and BOOTP.
  -- New CRC command to check integrity of flash images.
  -- Configure system is now much more flexible and allows most configuration
     to be done on the command-line
  -- Download and exec commands use default server if none specified
  -- Help improvements
  -- Improved command parsing
  -- Properly set stack pointer on XScale
  -- Improved command-line editing
  -- ARP cache fix which doubles TFTP throughput when going through router
  -- Many fixes to 91C111 Ethernet driver
  -- Changed 91C111 Ethernet driver to default to half-duplex mode.

Version 1.3
  -- Stack pointer now correctly located at end of memory for CerfPDA (64M)
  -- Removed erroneous DHCP attempt message
  -- CS8900 reset on SA-1110 only now
  -- Code cleanup, consolidation
  -- Various fixes for PXA250 devices
  -- Linux kernel will now be moved automatically to the right place in
     memory based on the information contained in the zImage

Version 1.2
  -- Fixed CHANGE-NOTES file
  -- Added INSTALL document
  -- Strip the PDA binary
  -- Added automatic DHCP requests if a network function is used
     and an IP address has not already been assigned
  -- Cleaned up code and added more comments
  -- DEBUG macros added
  -- Default make target is now "all"
  -- Now works with automake-1.4
  -- Allows cross subnet transfers (DHCP/BOOTP requests a gw and subnet)
  -- Added "set gw" and "set mask" commands
  -- CerfBoard LEDs show status:
     0: Device started
     1: IBoot running from RAM
     2: Timer stablized
     3: User control terminated
     4: OS loaded (about to boot)
  -- Added CS8900 reset code

Version 1.1
  -- First release with the new directory structure
  -- Added DHCP
  -- Removed partitioning support
  -- Added CHANGE-NOTES, RELEASE-NOTES, COPYING and updated README
  -- Moved from CVS to BitKeeper for SCM (http://www.bitkeeper.com)
  -- Created a library structure
  -- Changed the autoconf/automake scripts/makefiles to be as simple as
     possible
  -- Moved the user documentation to /documentation
  -- Optimized UDP/IP system for speed increase
  -- Moved to automake 1.5
  -- Added entries for XScale
  -- Added WinCE helper functions (updatece, runce)

Version 1.0
  -- First release
