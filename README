============================================================================
INTRODUCTION

I-Boot is the bootloader for Intrinsyc hardware platforms.  It allows
an embedded device developer to download and run Linux or Windows CE
kernels. There is a command-line interface to allow the developer to
coordinate the downloading with the development computer.

============================================================================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The hardware device should have:
    - a serial cable connecting it to a port on your development PC
    - an Ethernet connection to a LAN so that it is accessible from
      the development PC
    - I-Boot pre-loaded or loaded using JTAG as needed

The development PC should have:
    - a terminal program to communicate the with serial port of the
      hardware device (Hyperterminal for Windows developers, minicom or
      c-kermit for Linux developers). The terminal settings should be 38400
      baud, 8 bits, no flow control, stop bits at 1
    - TFTP server

============================================================================
COMMAND MODE

After properly connecting the hardware device and the development computer,
bring up the terminal program on the development PC and power up the device.
On the terminal program, you will be prompted to interrupt the countdown to
get to the I-Boot interactive mode.

	IBoot>

At the prompt, to get a list of commands type:
	IBoot> help
	
To get information on a particular command, type:
	IBoot> help <command>

For example, to get help on the download command, type:
	IBoot> help download

See the USAGE file for a entire list of all the commands supported by I-Boot.

Some control characters have special functions:

        DEL (delete)   delete the previous character
        ^H (backspace) delete the previous character
        ^P             recall the previously-entered line (only works if it
                       is the first key pressed on a line)
        ^U             delete the entire line

All other control characters are ignored and cause a BEL character to be sent
which normally causes the terminal to beep.

============================================================================
LINUX DEVELOPMENT

To create a Linux system, enter the following commands.  Substitute
the name of your files for those within the <brackets>, and substitute the
TFTP server's IP address for x.x.x.x.

For SA-1110 CerfPod, CerfCube or CerfBoard:

	IBoot> download tftp:x.x.x.x <zImage> 0xc0000000

        IBoot> flashverify 0x60000 0xc0000000 0x100000

        IBoot> download tftp:x.x.x.x <jffs filesystem> 0xc0000000

        IBoot> flashverify 0x160000 0xc0000000 <displayed jffs filesystem size>

        IBoot> boot

For SA-1110 CerfPDA:

        IBoot> download tftp:x.x.x.x <zImage> 0xc0000000

        IBoot> flashverify 0xc0000 0xc0000000 0x100000

        IBoot> download tftp:x.x.x.x <jffs filesystem> 0xc0000000

        IBoot> flashverify 0x1c0000 0xc0000000 <displayed jffs filesystem size>

        IBoot> boot

For PXA250 CerfBoard or CerfPDA:

        IBoot> download tftp:x.x.x.x <zImage> 0xa0000000

        IBoot> flashverify 0xc0000 0xa0000000 0x100000

        IBoot> download tftp:x.x.x.x <jffs filesystem> 0xa0000000

        IBoot> flashverify 0x1c0000 0xa0000000 <displayed jffs filesystem size>

        IBoot> boot

This will download and flash the Linux system.

============================================================================
WinCE DEVELOPMENT

To run a WinCE .bin file, prepare Platform Builder to upload the .bin file,
and type:

	IBoot> runce

To flash the .bin file, prepare Platform Builder to upload the .bin file, and
type:

	IBoot> updatece

============================================================================
BOOTLOADER UPGRADE

It is possible to upgrade I-Boot to a newer version using an older version
of the bootloader.  If you decide to do so, be extremely careful that you
enter the commands correctly and use the correct image, because a problem
upgrading the bootloader can render your device unusable and will require
returning it to the manufacturer for repair.

For SA-1110 CerfPod, CerfCube, CerfBoard or CerfPDA:

	IBoot> download tftp:x.x.x.x <i-boot-image> 0xc0000000

        IBoot> flashloader 0 0xc0000000 0x20000

        IBoot> reboot

For PXA250 CerfBoard or CerfPDA:

	IBoot> download tftp:x.x.x.x <i-boot-image> 0xa0000000

        IBoot> flashloader 0 0xa0000000 0x40000

        IBoot> reboot

The reboot command is not found in older versions of I-Boot.  You can simply
power down then power up your device instead.
