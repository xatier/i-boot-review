EEPROM Storage Format
---------------------
This section describes the format of the data stored in the configuration 
EEPROM.

The configuration EEPROM is 16 KB in size (16 kilobytes).

The first 8 bytes of the EEPROM is reserved for versioning information.
The first 2 bytes should be:

Offset   	Value	
00		0xEF
01		0xBE

For compatibility if writing the remaining 6 reserved bytes, zeros should 
be used.

Immediately following the reserved bytes are Tag/Item pairs.  Each 
tag/item pair has the following format:

Field			Size in Bytes	
Tag Length		1 or 2
Tag Value		0 to 32767
Item Length		1 or 2
Item Value		0 to 32767
CRC			2

Tag/Item pairs follow each other in EEPROM memory with no padding 
in between.  A tag/item pair with a zero tag length and a zero item length 
signifies the end of tags in the EEPROM.  On such a tag/item pair the 
CRC will also be zero.

Tag and Item lengths specify the byte lengths of the values only.  The 
length fields themselves are not included.

Tag and Item values can be any type of data (ASCII, Unicode, Binary).  
Typically an application or program will search for particular tag/item 
pairs by examining the data in the tag part.  The lengths of the tag and 
item data are unambiguous sizes in bytes, and any program code is able to 
step over tag/item pairs it does not understand.

A tag length field is either 1 or two bytes.  If the value of the byte is less 
than 128 (0x00 -> 0x7F), then the length is the value of the byte.  If the 
value is equal to or greater than 128, the value is masked with 127 (0x7F) 
and forms the upper byte of a two-byte length value.  The next byte in the 
EEPROM is the lower byte of the two-byte length.

Here is an example of a single tag/item pair in EEPROM:

EEPROM contents (hex)		Length	
--------------------------------------
06 03 06 ...			0x06 bytes (6 decimal)
84 03 06 ...			0x0403 bytes (1027 decimal)

The CRC at the end of a tag/item pair is a 16-bit CRC computed using
the 16-bit CRC algorithm known as CRC-CCITT-16 (the same one used by the
XMODEM-CRC file transfer protocol).  The CRC is computed from the sequential
contents of the tag length, tag value, item length, and item value.

An example of a complete tag/item pair:

EEPROM contents             Interpretation
------------------------------------------
EF BE 00 00 00 00 00 00     EEPROM header
06                          tag length (6 bytes)
4D 41 43 41 44 30           tag value (tag "MACAD0")
06                          item length (6 bytes)
00 D0 CA F1 05 03           item value (MAC address 00-D0-CA-F1-05-03)
D4 EC                       CRC value for tag/item pair
00                          tag length (0 bytes)
00                          item length (0 bytes)
00 00                       CRC field for completeness
