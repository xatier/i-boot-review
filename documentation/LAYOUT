Flash Layout
************

This document describes the flash layout of the various Intrinsyc Cerf 
devices.

CerfPDA (SA-1110 and PXA250), CerfBoard/CerfCube (PXA250)
  - Bootloader = 0x0 - 0x3FFFF      Flash Block 0
  - Bootloader Reserved = 0x40000 - 0xBFFFF Flash Blocks 1 and 2
  - Kernel     = 0xC0000 - 0x1BFFFF Flash Blocks 3 - 10 (inclusive)
  - FS         = 0x1C0000 - end*    Flash blocks 11-127* (inclusive)
  - FIS        = 0x1fc0000 - end    Flash block 127 (only if createfis is used)

CerfBoard/CerfCube (SA-1110)
  - Bootloader = 0x0 - 0x1FFFF      Flash Block 0
  - Bootloader Reserved = 0x20000 - 0x5FFFF Flash Blocks 1 and 2.
  - Kernel     = 0x60000 - 0x15FFFF Flash Blocks 3 - 6  (inclusive)
  - FS         = 0x160000 - end*    Flash Blocks 7 - 127* (inclusive)
  - FIS        = 0xfe0000 - end     Flash block 127 (only if createfis is used)

* If a RedBoot partition table is created by the createfis command, then the
filesystem must end one flash block before the end of the device.  Be sure
to enable RedBoot support in the MTD driver of your kernel if you use this
feature.
