NAME
	createfis - Create a RedBoot-compatible partition table

SYNOPSIS
	createfis <length1> [<length2> ...]

DESCRIPTION
	Creates a partition table in the last block of flash in RedBoot format.

	The size arguments are the sizes of each partition in units of flash
	blocks, in sequential order, starting with I-Boot itself in block 0.
